Welcome to my blog! As a programmer, I am enthusiastic about documenting and sharing the challenges I encounter and the knowledge I acquire in my work.

The main purpose of this blog is to record my technical growth journey, and I hope these contents can help fellow technology enthusiasts like me. Here are the main areas I focus on:

Cloud Native: From architecture design to practical applications, I am dedicated to exploring how cloud native technologies can enhance the scalability, reliability, and resilience of systems.
Edge Computing: Investigating the applications and technical implementations of edge computing, and how performing computation and storage near data sources can reduce latency and increase efficiency.
Containers: Researching the latest developments in container technology, including tips and best practices for using Docker and Kubernetes to achieve more efficient application deployment and management.
Here, you will find detailed technical articles, practical experiences, case studies, and my insights on the latest technology trends. I believe that as long as we keep learning and sharing, we can all find our own path in the ocean of technology.

If you have any suggestions or questions, feel free to reach out to me. Let's learn, grow, and enjoy the joy of coding together!

Happy reading!
